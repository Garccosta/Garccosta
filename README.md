###  👋 Hello World!🌎

My name is Gabriel, I was born in Rio de Janeiro and 
I am currently living in Teresopolis.

I am just a simple guy, passionate about technology, nature 
and spirituality. 
I think one of my biggest traits is my curiosity. 
Avid learner, I take learning as a hobby.

🎁Life long dreams:
- Freedom(in all its aspects: financial, geographical, of choice, and ultimately from ego...);
- Have a positive impact on people´s lives.
